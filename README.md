In recent years, a significant number of question answering (QA) systems that retrieve answers to natural language questions from knowledge graphs (KG) have been introduced. However, finding a benchmark to appropriately measure the quality of a question answering system is a difficult task because of (1) the high degree of variation with respect to the fine-grained properties among the available benchmarks; (2) the available benchmarks are static by nature while the KG evolving over time; (3) the existing benchmarks in the literature target only a handful of KGs. We introduce SmartBench, an on-the-fly benchmarking system for QA over KGs systems that can be used to build a QA benchmark over any KG. The benchmark generated by SmartBench is guaranteed to cover all the properties of the natural language questions and queries that were encountered in the literature as long as the targeted KGâ€™s topology demonstrates these properties. Moreover, SmartBench generates benchmarks that follow the same standards and complexity distribution to solve the variation of the fine-grained properties among generated benchmarks.
